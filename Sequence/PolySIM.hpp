  @brief declaration of Sequence::PolySIM, a class to analyze coalescent simulation data
*/
/*!
  \class Sequence::PolySIM Sequence/PolySIM.hpp
  \ingroup popgenanalysis
  This class inherits from Sequence::PolySNP.  It is a collection
  of analysis routines for coalescent simulation data, and is 
  constructed from a const Sequence::SimData *.  The main difference is
  that outgroup information is not required, as the 0,1 coding of a
  SimData object (usually) reflects ancestral and derived.
