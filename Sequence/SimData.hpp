  @brief Declaration of Sequence::SimData, a class representing polymorphism data
  from coalescent simulations generated under an infinite-sites scheme
*/

/*! \class Sequence::SimData Sequence/SimData.hpp
  \ingroup polytables
  \ingroup coalescent
 A class for reading in data from ms. ms is Dick
 Hudson's coalescent simulation program, available from
 http://home.uchicago.edu/~rhudson1/.  This class reads in
 the data one record at a time.  As of the time this document
 was written, the output of Hudon's program for one run looks like:\n
 \n
 //\n
 segsites: 10\n
 positions: 0.2512 0.3212 0.3449 0.4386 0.4571 0.4842 0.5745 0.6333 0.7042 0.9928 \n
 0100010010\n
 0000000100\n
 0100010011\n
 0000000000\n
 0100010010\n
 0101010010\n
 0100010011\n
 0110010010\n
 1100111010\n
 0000000000\n
 \n
 Look at the example program tajd.cc for an example of how to pipe
 simulated data into a C++ program using these libraries.
\note Be sure that you notice that the positions of the segregating sites
fall in the interval (0,1].
