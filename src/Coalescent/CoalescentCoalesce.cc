    @brief Common ancestor routine for coalescent simulation.  Merges
    chromosome segments and updates marginal trees.

    Common ancestor routine for coalescent simulation. This routine performs
    the merging of two lineages by a coalescent event.  Such merges usually 
    require two sorts of operations.  The first is an update to the segments
    contained in a chromosome, and the second is an update of the nodes
    on a marginal tree.
    \param time the time at which the coalecent event is occuring
    \param ttl_nsam the total sample size being simulated
    \param current_nsam the current sample size in the simulation
    \param c1 the array index of the first chromosome involved in the coalescent event
    \param c2 the array index of the second chromosome involved in the coalescent event
    \param nsites the total mutational length of the region begin simulated.  In the
    language of Hudson (1983), this is the number of infinitely-many-alleles loci in the
    simulation.
    \param nlinks a pointer to the number of "links" currently in the simulation.
    A link is the region between two sites, such that a chromosome currently with k sites has 
    k-1 links
    \param sample a pointer to the vector of chromosomes which makes up the sample
    \param sample_history a pointer to the ancestral recombination graph
    \return the decrease in current_nsam due to the coalescent event.  Usually, 
    the return value is 1.  Sometimes, however, it is two, when the two chromosomes
    being merged have no ancestral material on the same marginal tree.
