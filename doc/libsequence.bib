               in population genetics. Here we introduce the singleton density
               score (SDS), a method to infer very recent changes in allele
               frequencies from contemporary genome sequences. Applied to data
               from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in
               the ancestors of modern Britons during the past ~2000 to 3000
               years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and the
               major histocompatibility complex, and in favor of blond hair and
               blue eyes. For polygenic adaptation, we find that recent
               selection for increased height has driven allele frequency
               shifts across most of the genome. Moreover, we identify shifts
               associated with other complex traits, suggesting that polygenic
               adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and
               phenotypic variation in modern humans.",

  abstract = "By comparing the low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency parts of
              the frequency spectrum, we gain information on the evolutionary
              forces that influence the pattern of polymorphism in population
              samples. We emphasize the high-frequency variants on which
              positive selection and negative (background) selection exhibit
              different effects. We propose a new estimator of theta (the
              product of effective population size and neutral mutation rate),
              thetaL, which is sensitive to the changes in high-frequency
              variants. The new thetaL allows us to revise Fay and Wu's H-test
              by normalization. To complement the existing statistics (the
              H-test and Tajima's D-test), we propose a new test, E, which
              relies on the difference between thetaL and Watterson's thetaW.
              We show that this test is most powerful in detecting the recovery
              phase after the loss of genetic diversity, which includes the
              postselective sweep phase. The sensitivities of these tests to
              (or robustness against) background selection and demographic
              changes are also considered. Overall, D and H in combination can
              be most effective in detecting positive selection while being
              insensitive to other perturbations. We thus propose a joint test,
              referred to as the DH test. Simulations indicate that DH is
              indeed sensitive primarily to directional selection and no other
              driving forces.",

              both soft and hard sweeps in population genomic data from a
              single population. We compare our new method with classic
              single-population haplotype and site frequency spectrum
              (SFS)-based methods and show that it is more robust, particularly
              to recombination rate variation. However, all statistics show
              some sensitivity to the assumptions of the demographic model.
              Additionally, we show that nSL has at least as much power as
              other methods under a number of different selection scenarios,
              most notably in the cases of sweeps from standing variation and
              incomplete sweeps. This conclusion holds up under a variety of
              demographic models. In many aspects, our new method is similar to
              the iHS statistic; however, it is generally more robust and does
              not require a genetic map. To illustrate the utility of our new

              is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of
              positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to
              either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution
              of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary
              processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a
              unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the

              regions of low recombination where there is not much variation
              and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the
              hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small (<1 kb) region.
              Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila

              the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the

              the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within

              The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination
              events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the
              number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously
              inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the
              mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined
              from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and

              It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the

              a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The

              adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously,
              producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity
              of the adaptive site. Current statistical methods were expressly
              designed to detect hard sweeps and most lack power to detect soft

              adaptation in species such as Drosophila melanogaster, where all
              three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft
              selective sweeps and where there is evidence that the effective

              rather than hard sweeps. We discuss the implications of these

              identifying many selective sweeps. For most of these sweeps, the
              favored allele remains unknown, making it difficult to
              distinguish carriers of the sweep from non-carriers. In an
              ongoing selective sweep, carriers of the favored allele are
              likely to contain a future most recent common ancestor.
              Therefore, identifying them may prove useful in predicting the
              evolutionary trajectory--for example, in contexts involving
